    title : Mechanism of membrane transporters
    description : >
      Our work aims to provide a molecular description of the transport mechanism(s) of sugar transporters from the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) using a novel combination of mass-spectrometry based methods and modelling.

    title : Mechanism of multi-drug efflux pumps
    description : >
      We use state-of-the-art hybrid-mass spectrometry to uncover the molecular level interactions of drugs with multidrug efflux pumps, enabling the exploration of their synergistic binding with lipids and to identify stable complex intermediates.

  - name  : Argyris Politis
    image : images/team/Argyris.png
    designation : Principal Investigator, Senior Lecturer in Systems Biology
    description : Argyris has obtained degrees from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece and Imperial College London. As a post-doctoral researcher, he has worked in Cambridge and Oxford University with Prof. Dame Carol Robinson, as well as spending time at UCSF with Prof. Andrej Sali. His recent work led to the development of a mass spectrometry-based hybrid method for assembly modelling of large and heterogeneous protein complexes. This work was published in Nature Methods and Nature Chemistry.

  - name  : Richard Bradshaw
    image : images/team/Richard.png
    designation : Research Associate
    description : Richard is working on the modelling of HDX data from MD simulations.

  - name  : Valeria Calvaresi
    image : images/team/Valeria.png
    designation : Research Associate
    description : Valeria is an experimental post-doc exploring the application and development of HDX-MS on a variety of membrane proteins.

  - name  : Ruby Jia
    image : images/team/Ruby.png
    designation : PhD Student (3rd Year)
    description : Ruby's project involves investigating the molecular mechanism of membrane transporters and disease-related mutant variants, using a combination of native MS and HDX-MS. Co-supervised by Prof. Paula Booth (Kingâ€™s College London).

  - name  : Joanna Toporowska
    image : images/team/Joanna.png
    designation : PhD Student (2nd Year)
    description : Joanna is a graduate of Pharmaceutical Analysis and an engineer in Chemical Technology. Her PhD project involves developing the HDX-MS technology to interrogate membrane protein dynamics and test how a native-like lipid environment affects drug binding. Co-supervised by Dr Jonathan Hopper (OMass Therapeutics).

  - name  : Damon Griffiths
    image : images/team/Damon.png
    designation : PhD Student (1st Year)
    description : Damon is a Waters and LIDo funded PhD student whose project focusses on the membrane protein NTSR1. Damon will utilise a variety of cutting-edge HDX techniques to investigate NTSR1 and other membrane proteins to probe their intrinsic dynamics.

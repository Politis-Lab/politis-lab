**Description**

Deadline: Position no longer available

The project involves the study of membrane protein dynamics within their native lipid environment. In particular, the project will use the emerging hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) technology to enable conformational fingerprints of membrane protein in lipid context. Applicants should have completed a PhD or have submitted a thesis, in biochemistry, molecular biology or related field. The successful candidate will have extensive experience in membrane protein expression and purification. Experience in working with lipids and characterising expression levels are important. Experience in structural biology and/or mass spectrometry is desirable but not essential.

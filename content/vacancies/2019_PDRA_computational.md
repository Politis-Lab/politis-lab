**Description**

Deadline: October 13th 2021

The project involves the development of new computational tools to characterise membrane protein structure and dynamics in lipid bilayers. In particular, the project will use the emerging hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) technology to guide 3D structural modelling of membrane proteins and their complexes within their native lipid environment. Applicants should have completed a PhD or have submitted a thesis, in computer science, chemistry, physics or related field. The successful candidate will have extensive experience in computational and structural biology and molecular level simulations of proteins. Experience in working with membrane proteins and/or mass spectrometry is desirable but not essential.
